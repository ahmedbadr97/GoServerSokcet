Detective Conan and Gehad the Gone Girl


Gehad is a lovely, lovely girl with a lovely, lovely smile. She likes to read and she likes to tread. One day she decided to have a walk in the woods near her home. Her mother warned her not to venture in the woods or tread, or some monster in the woods might make her bleed. She went anyway.



It has been more than three day since Gehad went to the woods, and she never came back. Her mother was worried, so she hired the detective from Japan. Conan went investigating all around, but not a clue has been found. Many neighbors have witnessed her somewhere, so Conan decided, “why don’t we ask them all something.”
